This leads me to believe that the animals are to be treated like humans or even better. However, because of this we can be led to believe that the main message the author is trying to teach us is that Nothing in life is fair, nor will it ever get better. Even though this may sound pessimistic, it is what I see as a common theme within this book, as the main theme points towards this fact. Evidence to support this can be found by Benjamin predicting this, and even boxers&#39; stories. </span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">Well, there is more than alot of evidence to back up my claim of this book being very narcissistic, as the animals are just mean and cruel leaders in general. My first point to support this is that the &ldquo;pigs&rdquo; were the ones who acted better than everyone else and forced certain rules among others through force and manipulation as they wanted to be the best, and they also became what they strove to defeat. The pigs also have the nature of humans as they also became very greedy and they also took up jones place and even proceeded to murder their own kind. Some evidence to support this is, &ldquo;Boxer passed it off as usual with &quot;Napoleon is always right!&quot;, but Clover, who thought she remembered a definite ruling against beds, went to the end of the barn and tried to puzzle out the Seven Commandments which were inscribed there. Finding herself unable to read more than individual letters, she fetched Muriel [&hellip;] &quot;Muriel,&quot; she said, &quot;read me the Fourth Commandment. Does it not say something about never sleeping in a bed?&quot; [&hellip;] With some difficulty Muriel spelt it out... &quot;It says, &#39;No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets,&quot;&#39; she announced finally.&rdquo;, (Orwell, 6/102). This shows that the pigs had changed the barn wall to change the rules so that they can use stuff that they previously banned as it would benefit them and no one else as they previously wanted to preserve the barnhouse as a museum, but they wanted to sleep in it so they did that. This ties back to them being narcissistic. Another point from the book to support my claim is the boxer&#39;s story as he was still slaughtered after working so hard and for what? A box of whiskey made from boxer&#39;s death? In which they modified the rules themselves to drink? Yes, yes that is the full story of what happened that night, and they passed it off to the other animals as they sent them to a very nice hospital. Some evidence to support this is, &quot;I was at his bedside at the very last. And at the end, almost too weak to speak, he whispered in my ear that his sole sorrow was to have passed on before the windmill was finished. &#39;Forward, comrades!&#39;&rdquo;, (Orwell, 9/134). This evidence shows that the pigs are very good liars, as they lied to the rest of the animals that boxer was in good care, and that they tried to their very last breath to save boxer. But the fact is, they sent boxer to the butcher for money for the whiskey. This continues to prove my main point that nothing in life is fair, nor will it ever get better. And even though this may sound pessimistic, it is what I see as a common theme within this book, as the main theme points towards this fact. </span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">The events in this book can even relate with outside sources, and current day events, such as the war on Ukraine right now. The cruelty of the book can relate to real life as Orwell implies, as the Russians are very large, but also cruel. &nbsp;This can be related to the pigs and as soon as they got big, and had power, they rained down havok on everyone alike, which can be said for the same of Russia and ukraine. Some evidence to support this can be found from CBS news, &ldquo;Uman, Ukraine &mdash; Ukraine&#39;s government said 10 hospitals have been completely destroyed in Russia&#39;s invasion, including one that was decimated by a Russian missile strike on Monday. &nbsp;&quot;I want to cry, because we had a connection between Ukraine and Russia,&quot; doctor Anatoli Pavlov said. &quot;Russian cruelty is so brutal.&quot; , (Williams, &frac12;). This shows that the bigger the country, the more damage they have invested in to afflict other countries as that is the only way for them to keep in power as that is how they win is by staying in power. This relates to animal farm as this is also how the pigs are kept in power, by showing feats of power stronger than anyone else can imagine, which honestly means that they have no real power in actuality. Another point to prove is the fact that they started out cruel in the first place, and never changed, which restates my point in which they will never change as they are always the same people, and even if they &ldquo;learn&rdquo;, they still wont change their ways. Some evidence to restate this point is, &ldquo;Imperial sentiment is weaved into the way the Russians think of themselves and the world. It is deeply rooted in their history and has profound psychological grounds. This trait of their national character belongs to the category of historical structures which the French historian Fernand Braudel called &ldquo;longue dur&eacute;e&rdquo; (long duration) to denote phenomena pervading societies in the long-term perspective. These phenomena have a much greater and long-lasting impact on the development of civilization than political (wars, battles, treaties, etc.) or economic events.&rdquo;, (Delman, 4). This is evidence coming from a firsthand russian, and shows that they can never change and that they will always be like that as that, ust like the pigs can never change and they will always be on top, and how they will always be cruel leaders, and they will hold empty promises.</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">Because of the following points, we can say that the animals are to be treated like humans or even better.

Even though this may sound pessimistic, it is what I see as a common theme within this book, as the main theme points towards this fact. Therefore, we can say that this is a very narcissistic book that can relate directly to events in real life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Williams, Holly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Russian Cruelty Is so Brutal&rsquo;: Ukrainians Cope with Devastation as </span></p><p class="c6 c11"><span>Government Says 10 Hospitals Have Been Completely Destroyed in Invasion.&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">CBS News</span><span class="c1">, CBS Interactive, 22 Mar. 2022, https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-hospitals-war-crimes/. </span></p><p class="c6"><span>Delman, Jan. &ldquo;Russia Will Never Change.&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">Medium</span><span class="c1">, Medium, 4 Mar. 2021, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c1">https://medium.com/@jandelman/russia-will-never-change-72cefeaa5528. </span></p><p class="c6 c9 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c12 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c11 c9 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
